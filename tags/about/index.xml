In my spare time, I have developed web applications, published this blog, created animatronic props for conventions, and built a small technology lab/makerspace in my house. My homelab now includes a custom built virtualization server, a Prusa i3 3d printer, and a 50 watt RF CO2 laser cutter.</description></item></channel></rss>
