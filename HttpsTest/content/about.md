Since graduating with a BS in Computer Science from Clemson University in 2017, I have worked as a professional software engineer for the past 3 years. In my spare time, I have developed web applications, published this blog, created animatronic props for conventions, and built a small technology lab/makerspace in my house. My homelab now includes a custom built virtualization server, a Prusa i3 3d printer, and a 45 watt CO2 laser cutter.

Immediately after college, I moved to New York and started a role as a Big Data Engineer for Atos of North America. In my time there I worked with a wonderful small team of talented engineers developing a distributed structured and unstructured data ingestion and analytics platform.

After that first year, I took an amazing opportunity to work for NIWC Atlantic in the city I now call my home, Charleston. In the two years since my move I have had the pleasure of working as a Full Stack web developer utilizing modern technology such as Golang and PolymerJS web components. Below is a more structured overview of my experience. To contact me about opportunities in Charleston, please check out my LinkedIn.
